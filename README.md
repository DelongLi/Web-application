CloudFitness 

Introduction: 

CloudFitness is an online web application that enables users who want to lose weight or get fit to create their own calorie-reduced plan. The purpose of our Web APP is to encourage more and more people to join us to work out in an engaging and interesting way.

Background/Problem solving:

Based on user’s setting information like current BMI, ideal BMI,body fat, BMR, and things like that, we provide several personally-fitted and optimal combinations of diet plans and exercise plans such as running, riding, or work out plans for them to select, depending on what kinds of sports they are interested in.  

Solution to make life easier:

	By setting the distribution of calories that users want to reduce in diet plan and running program,  users can have a strict calorie-intake control via our daily diet plan. Moreover, in terms of the daily sport program, we provide a real time  “finding friends/groups around you” feature that allows users to search for friends/groups (or strangers!) who have a common hobby on certain sports in close proximity so that users can join local chatting-groups associated with their interested sports like running group, climbing group, fitness group. E.g. a user wants to lose 3000 calories in 10 days, 1000 calorie in food, 1300 in running and 700 in climbing. So, our Web App will provide a custom diet plan and make a 10-days running plan and climbing plan for them. Also, our Web  APP allows users to join in running chat-groups and climbing chat-groups in order to make arrangements to do exercise together and share their experiences. Since some users may be too lazy to do exercises, joining groups with common hobbies can motivate them to keep up with each other, so they can stick with the daily exercise plan more easily.  

Targeting Customer: 

	Firstly, CloudFitness provides reasonable diet plans and healthy food recipes for users based on how much weight they want to lose in a specific time period. Secondly, CloudFitness recommends appropriate sports plans for users in terms of their exercises preference to help them burn enough calories to accomplish their goals. Moreover, CloudFitness encourages users to find workout partners with similar goals, which help users to supervise each other in a motivating way. Based on these features, the target audience are people who want to lose weight in order to build a healthy body figure, and people who are interested in fitness and want to systematically combine different kinds of exercises to get fit. They will definitely see the application as a useful tool to help them achieve their goals.
Feature/Sample Stories: 

	Users can login/logout to this app by entering their username and passwords. New users can click the “sign in now” button to register for a new account.

	Users are able to record their own information like weight, height, age, and then this app will calculate their BMI, body fat, BMR… Users can set their own goals (e.g. how much weight they want to lose) and this app will provide them with meal plans, daily calories consuming plans and work out plans depending on their preference of sports. 

	This app allows users to add friends/join groups around them and chat with them in real time, and users can check their friends’ profiles (weight, height, BMI and their historical weight, BMI …). Also, users can set some of their profile information to be private if they wish.

	Through food recipe API based on user’s profile, we provide  reasonable diet plans and healthy food recipes so they can make food by themselves at home. Also, we can recommend restaurants around users that have similar food in the diet plan if they do not want to cook.

This app can help to record users’ work out check-ins, amount of consumed calories. By using this app, users can check their friends’ status, whether they have finished their work out or haven’t worked out today. Also, users are allowed to invite friends or make a work out group so that they can make work out as a team by appointments.

	This app can also supervise users and urge them to work out more frequently. For example, if someone hasn't worked out on some day, this app will give the user some notification like “Your friends have finished their today’s workout plan!” (this can motivate other team members to work out)
Users can use this app to find work out groups and join them. In the work out group, members can check in after finishing their daily work out plans and then their status will be changed to “today’s work out finished”. They can check how many group members have finished their daily work out plans and other group members’ profiles and status -- whether they have worked out today or not.

	Also, users are able to find nearby users, groups via GPS and Google Map API and send friend request or group join request.

User interface design:
	
The user interface design for the application will contain elements related to fitness, sports and nutrition in order to attract audience attention. 

Difficult Level:
	
Yes, the amount of work required in this proposal is enough for five group members. Our Web APP requires food recipes API, GPS information, real-time group chat, and real-time updates of exercising status and so on.
